//this file adapts the monster framework to create a game: Monsterle
//Monsterle is a wordle clone where you have 6 guesses to name a monster
//After each guess, the CPU reveals more details to the monster in the following order:
//0. (no guesses yet) nothing
//1. size
//2. type
//3. ability scores
//4. CR
//5. feature and attack names
